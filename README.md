Food is wasted throughout the food chain. One of the biggest contributors to food waste is when food isn’t purchased or used wisely - we sometimes buy and store more food than is necessary. Food doesn’t have an infinite shelf life, so ingredients often end up in a bin before they end up on a plate. In Finland, up to 160 million kilograms of food is wasted each year after it’s been purchased. That’s nearly 25 kilograms of food waste per person! This not only impacts the finances of shops and customers, but also, it can have a huge impact on CO2 emissions.

The good news is, food waste is entirely unnecessary and can be eliminated with the right solutions and motivations in place!

That’s why we’re introducing a web app that can help consumers keep track of the ingredients they have on hand, which recipes they use most, and informs them when the ingredients they purchase often go on sale. K-Challenge is an integratable addition to the widely used K-Ruoka web app. It specializes in offering consumers challenges to utilize the ingredients they already have, discover the ingredients they’re missing for a certain recipe, and make more sustainable and healthier choices when it comes to what foods they purchase from K-Group shops.

Key features:

- The app will keep track of what ingredients have been purchased and common purchasing behaviors
- The app will make suggestions for what can be prepared with existing ingredients
- App challenges can make it easier to change user habits, for example, by improving diet to improve health and encouraging them to utilize ingredients that are in season
- Rewards encourage users to complete challenges they love and try out new challenges regularly
- Push notifications notify the user when their local shop puts items they regularly buy on sale - tackling food waste in food distribution as well
- Push notifications can also notify users about ingredients they often waste, directing them to recipes they might enjoy that utilize these ingredients, so they are not discouraged from buying these ingredients in the future
