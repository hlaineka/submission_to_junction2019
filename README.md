This repo is the prototype of our Junction2019 challenge for sustainability during 15.11.2019 - 17.11.2019.

When food isn’t purchased or used wisely, ingredients can end up in a bin instead of on a plate - in Finland, 
up to 160 million kilograms of food is wasted each year after it’s been purchased.

The aim of our project was to help individuals build healthy and sustainable habits by adding K-Challenges 
to the existing web app of K-ruoka. K-Challenges would offer different challenges to make more sustainable 
and healthy choices with the help of the data offered by K-ruoka and other K-Group services user data. By using
the challenges the user could be rewarded with Plussa-points. Rewards encourage users to complete challenges 
and come back for more.

K-Challenges could by example help people to utilize what they already have by discovering delicious new recipes, 
or promote healthier choices by suggesting substitute products and recepies when trying to reduce the usage of meat
of the familys carbon footprint. K-Challenges could also offer solutions to more efficiently use seasonal produce
and help reduce food waste in this area. Push notifications alert customers when their favorite items are on 
sale at the shops they frequent - helping prevent food waste in shops. Notifications can also shed light on 
alarming patterns, such as purchasing large quantities of ingredients that are often wasted, and offer tips 
and solutions.
